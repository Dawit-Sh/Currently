# Currently


I do have have a good reads account but don't like tracking there IDK why i just love checking books there
so i created this minimal page hosted here on github to track what im currently reading and share it with my friends

The site is pretty simple and minimal all it does is fetches book detailes from the ```books.json``` file and displays them on the site and also the progress you are on, 

i did not implement the progress calculating formula in the books page cause most of the books i read are digital and 
the reader i use tells me the progress so why hussle, but for the physical copies i read i do have a ```progress.sh``` file.


```books.sh``` script simplifies the process of adding books, removing books and updating progress, better than using a CMS, database with backend or even google sheets. and works well on my phone too, i can use termux and do my task.
